- AVAMAN - as an avatar&smilies manager

SUMMARY:

A little module for managing System Avatars and Smilies.


USAGE:

Just install it.
You can upload avatars/smilies via an archive of tar.gz or zip.

If you are a smilies creator and want to distribute it, name the file like this.

(code).gif
(code).jpg
(code).png

(code) should be urlencoded. (eg '*'=>'%2A', '<'=>%3C, '|'=>%7C)
If you make a smile gif for :anotherpint:, name it like this:
[code]%3Aanotherpint%3A.gif[/code]
It will be imported as a smile with its code :anotherpint:

Then archive all smile images as a zip file, and distribute it.
It makes many xoopsers happy!
